This fertilization recommendation geographic information system is composed of Fertilization Recommendation Model and GIS. Specifically, it is a man-machine system based on computer technology. Collect, process, save and process the information in the process of fertilization, and provide various fertilization information to assist users in fertilization decision-making.

The ultimate goal of the system is to use the current advanced component GIS secondary development technology, database technology, and computer model simulation technology, take GIS technology as the core, and use visualization techniques to realize the effective integration of Fertilization Recommendation Model and applied GIS, based on various basic soil nutrient data and other spatial data, Establish fertilization recommendation geographic information system to realize fertilization recommendation based on geographic information system.
