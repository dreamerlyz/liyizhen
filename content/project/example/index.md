title: Urbanization in Hangzhou of China, 1978 – 2021
summary: This paper examines the urbanization process in Hangzhou of China from
  1978 to 2021 from the perspective of dual-track urbanization. The first track
  urbanization is sponsored by local government and state, and the second is a
  spontaneous track. This paper studies the relative roles of spontaneous and
  state-sponsored urbanization and their impacts on the spatial pattern,
  industrial structures, economic patterns, and characteristics of Hangzhou’s
  urbanization. It is found that government plays the leading role in
  urbanization, implementing policies on spatial structure, master plan, and
  economy. Spontaneous urbanization plays an important role in the process of
  urbanization, resulting in population migration, tertiary industry change, and
  economic innovation. Both tracks together guide Hangzhou’s urbanization into a
  pattern of its characteristics. The level of population urbanization is
  constantly improving; The development of urban and rural areas (spatial
  structure) is more coordinated; Remarkable achievements have been made in the
  construction of the digital economy, forming many strong private enterprises,
  characteristic towns, and development zones. The digital economy and private
  sectors have been booming since the 1990s, bring economic prosperity and
  urbanization. At this point, one could consider these as the distinguishing
  feature in Hangzhou’s urbanization, engendering the city’s modernization and
  urbanization.

In this project, we ascertained that Hangzhou's urbanization is driven by two tracks. The first track is state-sponsored focusing on the spatial expansion of cities and the construction of urban economy transformation through policies and master plans. The second track is informal and spontaneous urbanization. It can be reflected in industrial structure dynamics, initiated by local enterprisers, who operate private sectors, and by local and migrant residents who are devoted to new types of economy, namely digital economy. The model of dual-track urbanization features a considerable degree of credibility in that it has contributed to Hangzhou’s significant economic growth, the construction of urban economy transformation, and economic booms. It has engendered rapid urbanization with Hangzhou’s characteristics. However, the model of dual-track urbanization also faces major problems of sustainability and complexity. The heavy blending and interaction between state policies and local people’s subjectivity increase the difficulty of distinguishing which party essentially brings the most contribution to the urban economy and the city’s urbanization. Meanwhile, rapid urbanization takes place by undermining the balanced development in all regions, thus an unbalanced digital economy-level could be seen among regions, increasing spatial urbanization inequality.


Rooted in Hangzhou’s particular government-sponsored policies and plans, and the spontaneous floating and innovation of Hangzhou’s people and migrants, especially businessmen, the dual-track urbanization illuminates the importance of distinguishing form from function to better understand the operation and impacts of agents, namely government and residents. As a spatial result of the dual-track urbanization, Hangzhou has emerged as a form of a metropolis. Apparently, Hangzhou’s current model of urbanization rallies sufficient credibility as it has generated rapid economic growth and met the demand of various actors – from residents to businessmen, to migrants. However, the credibility might be limited to a degree of complexity and appears to be evidence of an increased merging between the two tracks which is now presenting challenges to the credibility of the strictly two-track divergence model.
