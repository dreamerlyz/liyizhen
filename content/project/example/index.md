This paper examines the urbanization process in Hangzhou of China from 1978 to 2021 from the perspective of dual-track urbanization. The first track urbanization is sponsored by local government and state, and the second is a spontaneous track. This paper studies the relative roles of spontaneous and state-sponsored urbanization and their impacts on the spatial pattern, industrial structures, economic patterns, and characteristics of Hangzhou’s urbanization. It is found that government plays the leading role in urbanization, implementing policies on spatial structure, master plan, and economy. Spontaneous urbanization plays an important role in the process of urbanization, resulting in population migration, tertiary industry change, and economic innovation. Both tracks together guide Hangzhou’s urbanization into a pattern of its characteristics. The level of population urbanization is constantly improving; The development of urban and rural areas (spatial structure) is more coordinated; Remarkable achievements have been made in the construction of the digital economy, forming many strong private enterprises, characteristic towns, and development zones. The digital economy and private sectors have been booming since the 1990s, bring economic prosperity and urbanization. At this point, one could consider these as the distinguishing feature in Hangzhou’s urbanization, engendering the city’s modernization and urbanization.
