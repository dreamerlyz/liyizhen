In this project, we ascertained that Hangzhou's urbanization is driven by two tracks. The first track is state-sponsored focusing on the spatial expansion of cities and the construction of urban economy transformation through policies and master plans. The second track is informal and spontaneous urbanization. It can be reflected in industrial structure dynamics, initiated by local enterprisers, who operate private sectors, and by local and migrant residents who are devoted to new types of economy, namely digital economy. The model of dual-track urbanization features a considerable degree of credibility in that it has contributed to Hangzhou’s significant economic growth, the construction of urban economy transformation, and economic booms. It has engendered rapid urbanization with Hangzhou’s characteristics. However, the model of dual-track urbanization also faces major problems of sustainability and complexity. The heavy blending and interaction between state policies and local people’s subjectivity increase the difficulty of distinguishing which party essentially brings the most contribution to the urban economy and the city’s urbanization. Meanwhile, rapid urbanization takes place by undermining the balanced development in all regions, thus an unbalanced digital economy-level could be seen among regions, increasing spatial urbanization inequality.


Rooted in Hangzhou’s particular government-sponsored policies and plans, and the spontaneous floating and innovation of Hangzhou’s people and migrants, especially businessmen, the dual-track urbanization illuminates the importance of distinguishing form from function to better understand the operation and impacts of agents, namely government and residents. As a spatial result of the dual-track urbanization, Hangzhou has emerged as a form of a metropolis. Apparently, Hangzhou’s current model of urbanization rallies sufficient credibility as it has generated rapid economic growth and met the demand of various actors – from residents to businessmen, to migrants. However, the credibility might be limited to a degree of complexity and appears to be evidence of an increased merging between the two tracks which is now presenting challenges to the credibility of the strictly two-track divergence model.
