The anti-racism movement brought the word "race" back to life and politics. However, how to define race and whether there is a clear definition between races are not clear. 

From the perspective of anthropology, this paper explores the impact of the development of multi-regional evolution theory and molecular biology on racial division. This paper argues that gene exchange and fitness genetic variation make it unreliable to divide the human race only by skin color and region. In the context of multiculturalism, we should not give up modern genetics to explore the differences within and between the currently divided ethnic groups. We should rationally look at the overall differences in some aspects between the currently divided ethnic groups, understand the impact of environment, variationï¼Œand communication on genes, and correctly understand the individual diversity within the race
